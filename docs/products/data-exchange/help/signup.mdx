To get data from the [Data Exchange](http://data.riverscapes.net), you need to create an account. You can do this by connecting a Google Account or Apple Account, or you can sign up with a username and password. We recommend using a Google account if you have the option.

This one account is used across the family of Riverscapes Consortium products including the [Data Exchange](http://data.riverscapes.net), [PBR Explorer](https://pbr.riverscapes.net) and [Riverscapes Reports](https://reports.riverscapes.net).
