## Importance of Organizations

In the Riverscapes Data Exchange, the administrative owner for a project can be an individual (User) or an Organization. An Organization can also be [attributed](attribution) to a project as a partner in various roles.

Data Exchange Organizations are linked with the [PBR Explorer](https://pbr.riverscapes.net), where they can be assigned to PBR projects as partners.

## Roles within an Organization

It is not possible to login as an Organization, only as an User. However, if a User has the necessary role, they can perform actions behalf of the organization.

Individual roles within an organization can be one of the following, in order of increasing privileges (ie each subsequent role has all the privileges of the previous role):

1. Viewer. Can see and download all projects (Public, Private, and Secret) for the organization
2. Contributor. Can upload, edit, and delete projects and collections belonging to the organization.
3. Administrator. Can edit an organization, and add and remove members from the organization.
4. Owner. Has full control of the organization including deleting it and assigning other owners.
