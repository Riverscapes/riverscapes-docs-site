		Cyber Castor is a cloud engine for automating riverscapes models. It is a tool that allows you to run models in the cloud, without having to worry about the infrastructure.

		Originally designed to run the Riverscapes [production grade models](https://tools.riverscapes.net) (VBET, BRAT etc.) in a scalable and efficient way, Cyber Castor is now a general purpose cloud engine that can run any model provided that it is parameterized correctly.

		The Riverscapes Consortium has used Cyber Castor to run the production grade models for two thirds of the continental United States. This has generated over 80,000 projects that are available in the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.xyz).

## Technical Details

Cyber Castor was developed by [North Arrow Research Ltd](https://northarrowresearch.com) and is built on top of the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) service. It is a node.js serverless application that can scale to run thousands of models in parallel. Administrators can monitor the progress of the models using a dashboard that provides visibility and control over all the jobs that are in flight. Individual tasks can be monitored, stopped if necessary or even restarted.
