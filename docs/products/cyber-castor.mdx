		Originally designed to run the [Riverscapes network models](https://tools.riverscapes.net) (VBET, BRAT etc.) in a scalable and efficient way, Cyber Castor is now a general purpose cloud engine that can run any model provided that it is parameterized correctly. It is a tool that allows you to run models in the cloud, without having to worry about the infrastructure.

		The Riverscapes Consortium has used Cyber Castor to run the production grade models for two over 99% of the continental United States. This has generated over 100,000 projects that are available in the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.xyz). Data from these model runs, and the 54,000,000 riverscapes that they encompass, can be extracted using the [Riverscapes reporting platform](https://reports.riverscapes.net).

## Technical Details

Cyber Castor was developed by [North Arrow Research Ltd](https://northarrowresearch.com) and is built on top of the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) service. It is a node.js serverless application that can scale to run thousands of models in parallel. Administrators can monitor the progress of the models using a dashboard that provides visibility and control over all the jobs that are in flight. Individual tasks can be monitored, stopped if necessary or even restarted.

## Your Models

Submit an inquiry to [support@riverscapes.freshdesk.com](mailto:support@riverscapes.freshdesk.com) is you are interested in learning more about what it would take to run your models using Cyber Castor. A prerequisite is that your model is Riverscapes compliant and writes outputs accompanied by a `project.rs.xml` metadata file.
