## Overview of PBR Explorer

Launched in May 2025, the latest version of PBR Explorer introduces a completely overhauled interface to upload, view, and organize process-based restoration projects. New features added include:  

- Streamlined Project Upload: Effortlessly add new projects to the Explorer as an individual or organization.
- Improved Project Detail: Users can now include additional details like timelines, budgets, and more for uploaded projects.
 - Enhanced Project Design: View current and completed restoration projects with greater clarity and detail.

These improvements aim to showcase and promote restoration work of individual practitioners and organizations to the broader restoration community.

The Location section contains geographic information about your project. You can enter coordinates by typing them into the Latitude and Longitude boxes (required), or selecting a location on the interactive map. In addition, you can define your project extent by uploading a GeoJSON file (optional). Finally, type in the Stream Name and Watershed Name (both required) into the provided text boxes.

This field should ideally be kept between 1-2 paragraphs and is optional to the user.

### Photos

You can upload project photos to the Photo section after your project is created and submitted to the Explorer. While this is optional (though recommended), each photo uploaded must be 100 MB or smaller. 

### Related Projects 

You can use the Related Projects section to link other existing projects to your restoration project, such as those with shared funding, different phase treatments, or close proximity. Simply use the search bar to locate those projects and click on the + Add to link them. This is an optional field.
