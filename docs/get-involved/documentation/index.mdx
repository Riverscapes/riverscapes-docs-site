The Riverscapes Consortium publishes documentation for our tools, methods, and standards using this website and a few others listed below. These websites are all produced using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)which is software that converts Markdown files into an interactive web site. 

* [learn more about Markdown](https://commonmark.org/), a convention for human-readable plain text files that includes basic formatting such as headings and links. 

## The Riverscapes documentation ecosystem

* [Source code documentation](Source_Code) explaining the various components of a tool and how they work
* [Tool web sites](WebSites) for end users to discover, download and run the tools
* [Riverscapes Projects](Riverscapes_Projects) metadata to accompany the outputs of each tool

The above resources are intended as a reference and guide for  RC developers and website contributors.
