Riverscapes serves its icons (as well as some other branded assets) from a [Content Delivery Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) (CDN) to ensure fast and reliable access to these resources globally. The CDN caches the icons on servers located in various geographic locations, reducing latency and improving load times for users regardless of their location.

## Riverscapes Icons

Below is a live browser of the icons available on the CDN. You can use the Ctrl-f (or Cmd-f on Mac) function of your browser to search for specific icons by name.

import IconBrowser from '@site/src/components/IconBrowser';

<IconBrowser />
