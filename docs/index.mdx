## About the Riverscapes Consortium

We are a collective of scientists, riverscape practitioners, and supporters brought together by shared challenges and common motivations. Our goal is promoting healthy riverscapes for all. [Learn more here](https://www.riverscapes.net/page/about).

We are committed to building open-source tools to make it easier for researchers, practitioners and students to manage their own riverscapes. The breadth of ecological challenges ahead of us requires a diverse community working together across disciplines, geographic boundaries, and perspectives. Our hope is that we can spark scientific collaborations worldwide to more effectively tackle the urgent challenge of riverscape degradation.

### Our Mission

Promoting vibrant, healthy riverscapes for all where thriving ecosystems and human societies can coexist and benefit one another for a more resilient future.
